# triviaGame
This is a turn based trivia game that has some elements of a fighting game. The styling is not great and there are some kinks, but it helped me cement my understanding of API's and Axios. I am proud of the logic I used to establish turn mechanics, attack mechanics, and ability mechanics. I made this with a VERY limited understanding of built-in JS methods and the broader JS functionality.
